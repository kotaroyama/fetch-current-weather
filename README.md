# fetch-current-weather

# Overview
This script returns the current weather and tempurate based on the city or ZIP code provided by the user.

# Context
There are many websites and apps that one can use to get weather information. However, due to my indecisiveness, I can't choose which website or app to get such information when I need it. That is why I created this very simple script so that I can instatntly get the necessary information.

#usage
When you run the script, it asks you whether to provide the name of the city or the ZIP code. If you want to look up the wheather by providing the name of the city, type "city" or "zip" for the zip code.
Next, simply enter the name of the city or the zip code based on the choice you made in the privious step.
There you have it -the script will return the current whether and ZIP code of the locaiton!
